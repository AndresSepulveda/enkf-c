This is example 3 for the EnKF-C package. It is based on example 1. It
demonstrates the framework for using partially masked curvilinear grid in PREP,
while using full grid in CALC and UPDATE. This may be needed for handling
topologically screwed grids, e.g. tri-polar ORCA grids.

PRE-REQUISITIVES

Set up example 1 as described in ../1/README.

TESTING

Run "make enkf" or "make enoi".
