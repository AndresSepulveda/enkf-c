This is example 2 for the EnKF-C package. It is equivalent to example 1 except
that the grid has been set as curvilinear rather than rectangular in
longitude-latitude (although in fact it is the same rectangular grid).
This example should yield the same results as example 1. See README and
Makefile from example 1 for more details.

PREREQUISITES

Set up example 1 as described in ../1/README.

TESTING ENKF

To assimilate with the EnKF, run "make enkf".
The analysed ensemble members will be of the form 
ensemble_6565/mem<num>_<var>.nc.analysis, where <num> is the member id, between
001 and 096, and <var> is one of the state variables: eta_t, temp, salt, u or v.

TESTING ENOI

To assimilate with the EnOI, run "make enoi". The analysis will be of the form
background/bg_<var>.nc.analysis.
