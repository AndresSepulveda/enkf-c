This is example 2 for the EnKF-C package. It is equivalent to example 1 except
that the grid has been set as curvilinear rather than rectangular in
longitude-latitude (although in fact it is the same rectangular grid).
That is, the only differences with example 1 are in files grid.prm and
grid_spec.nc. This example should yield the same results as example 1. See
README and Makefile from example 1 for more details.

PRE-REQUISITIVES

Set up example 1 as described in ../1/README.

TESTING

Run "make enkf" or "make enoi".
