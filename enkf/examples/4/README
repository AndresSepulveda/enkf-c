This is example 4 for the EnKF-C package. It is based on example 1 to
demonstrate a multi-grid setting. Note that the actual difference between
t-grid and c-grid is quite small to produce much different results compared to
a single grid setting.

PREREQUISITES

Set up example 1 as described in ../1/README.

TESTING ENKF

To assimilate with the EnKF, run "make enkf".
The analysed ensemble members will be of the form 
ensemble_6565/mem<num>_<var>.nc.analysis, where <num> is the member id, between
001 and 096, and <var> is one of the state variables: eta_t, temp, salt, u or v.

TESTING ENOI

To assimilate with the EnOI, run "make enoi". The analysis will be of the form
background/bg_<var>.nc.analysis.
