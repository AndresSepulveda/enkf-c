This is an example for the EnKF-C package. It has been put up based on the runs
of regional EnKF and EnOI reanalysis systems for Tasman Sea developed by Bureau
of Meteorology. It allows one to conduct a single assimilation for 23 December 
2007 (day 6565 since 1 January 1990) with either EnKF or EnOI.

Note that to reduce the example size 
(1) the grid has been reduced to 100 x 100 x 2
(2) global NAVO SST observations has been cut to regional observations only

Because of (1) assimilation of subsurface observations (TEM and SAL observation
types) is sort of funny, but is OK for testing purposes.

PRE-REQUISITIVES

1. To run this example you need to download example1-data.tar.gz from 

https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-joqvlrlCeRMjBtUFpRRHR1M0E&usp=sharing

and unpack in this directory.

2. You need to compile EnKF-C and copy executables enkf_prep, enkf_calc and
 enkf_update to the directory of the example.

3. You may wish to adjust NP_CALC and NP_UPDATE in Makefile according to the 
number of cores on your machine.

TESTING ENKF

To assimilate with the EnKF, run "make enkf".
The analysed ensemble members will be of the form 
ensemble_6565/mem<num>_<var>.nc.analysis, where <num> is the member id, between
001 and 096, and <var> is one of the state variables: eta_t, temp, salt, u or v.

TESTING ENOI

To assimilate with the EnOI, run "make enoi". The analysis will be of the form
background/bg_<var>.nc.analysis.

TESTING MODEL VALIDATION

Testing using EnKF-C for for validating a model against observations only, without data assimilation, run "make stats". The innovation statistics will be 
printed to the log of enkf_calc.

TESTING SINGLE OBSERVATION EXPERIMENT

Run "make singleob". The results are in background_6565/*.increment.

TESTING GENERATION OF ADDITIONAL POINTLOG FILES

The idea is that if something goes wrong with DA at particular locations, one
can add point logs at these locations in the main parameter file and re-run
enkf_calc and enkf_post "cheaply" (without re-calculating transforms for the
whole grid and re-updating the analysis) and investigate what happened.

Run "make enkf", then "make pointlogs". "make pointlogs" quickly adds a couple
of additional point logs in locations (50, 50) and (70, 50).

--

To clean up the analysis, run "make clean".

Apart from the EnKF/EnOI analyses, a number of auxiliary files are generated:

prep.out - log file from enkf_prep
calc.out - log file from enkf_calc
post.out - log file from enkf_post
observations.nc - pre-processed superobservations
observations-orig-nc - pre-processed original observations
enkf_diag.nc - observation impact file
X5.nc - 2D array of local ensemble transforms (EnKF)
w.nc - 2D array of local ensemble linear combination coefficients (EnOI)
spread.nc - spread of the corresponding ensemble
pointlog_30,50.nc -- point log with exaustive DA information for location (i,j)
  = (30,50)
inflation.nc -- inflation used for each state element
pointlog_50,50.nc, pointlog_70,50.nc -- two additional point logs generated
  when running "make pointlogs"

If you suspect that something went wrong, you may compare your logs with those
in the "logs" directory.

NOTE: for the 2-layer setting used has middle layer depths of 2.5 m and 
255.8842 m. EnKF-C assumes the top layer thickness of 5 m and bottom layer 
thickness of (255.8842 - 5) * 2 = 501.7684 m. The actual layer used for the 
bottom layer has depth from 242.6595 to 269.109 m. For this reason and because
of the vertical interpolation between layers to the depth of super observations
the results of assimilating in-situ T and S can not be expected to be physically
sensible.


Have fun,
