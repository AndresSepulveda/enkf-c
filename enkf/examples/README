example 1: 

A basic example set up based on a real system for the Tasman Sea. Setting
example 1 is prerequisite for running examples 2-4. See 1/README for more
detail.

example 2:

As example 1, demonstrates using curvilinear rather than a rectangular grid
in lon/lat. (Although the actual grid is the same as in example 1.)

example 3:

Demonstrates using partially masked curvilinear grid in PREP. This may be
necessary to handle topologically screwed grids, e.g. tri-polar ORCA grids.

example 4:

Demonstrates a multi-grid setting.
